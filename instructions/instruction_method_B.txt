# Agent Instructions for Method B: Entity-Pair Guided Sequential Extraction

## Repository
https://github.com/auto-res2/kg-extraction-entity-pair

## Task
Clone the repository, implement the method described in README.md, and run the experiment.

## API Keys
- GEMINI_API_KEY=REDACTED_GEMINI_API_KEY
- OPENAI_API_KEY=(see secrets .env file)

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/auto-res2/kg-extraction-entity-pair
cd kg-extraction-entity-pair
git clone https://github.com/YoumiMa/JacRED /tmp/JacRED
pip install google-genai
export GEMINI_API_KEY="REDACTED_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

## What to Do
1. Read the README.md thoroughly -- it contains the full experiment specification
2. The base implementation (Baseline + Two-Stage) is already provided in the repo
3. Implement the new method described in section 6 of the README
4. Run the experiment: all conditions (Baseline, Two-Stage, New Method) on the same 10 dev documents
5. The output should show a comparison table with P/R/F1 for all conditions
6. Commit and push results (results.json + updated code) to the repository

## Model Configuration
- Use model: gemini-3-flash-preview
- Set thinking_budget=0 in llm_client.py for fastest execution
- If you need to change model settings, edit llm_client.py

## Expected Output
A comparison table like:
```
              Precision   Recall     F1    TP    FP    FN
Baseline           ...      ...    ...   ...   ...   ...
Two-Stage          ...      ...    ...   ...   ...   ...
EntityPair         ...      ...    ...   ...   ...   ...
```

## Important Notes
- Do NOT modify evaluation.py (entity alignment + P/R/F1 computation) -- keep evaluation consistent
- Do NOT change the 10 evaluation documents or few-shot example
- The JacRED dataset must be at /tmp/JacRED/
- All results should be reproducible
